What is Rasa

Rasa is an open source Conversational AI framework. What I like about Rasa is you are not tied to a pre-built model or usecase (Dialogflow etc.). So you can customize it to your usecase which can be a market differentiator. Rasa is not a rule based framework (e.g. Botkit) and you don’t need to worry about putting your data in someone else’s cloud as in Dialogflow, Microsoft LUIS or Amazon Lex.

Rasa has two main components — Rasa NLU and Rasa Core.
